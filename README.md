# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems, it involves the design,development and testing deployment and maintenance of software products


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.Changing requirements which involves changes during the depoloyment cycle leading to project delays , Tight deadlines can make you deliver low quality software because of rushed development and compromised quality , technical debt which can increase maintance costs


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Requirements which involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
 Design creating high level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
 Implementation which is writing code and buiding the software according to the design specifications
 Testing that includes conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements 
 Deployment that is releasing the software to the users
 Maintenance which involves providing ongoing support , updates and enhancement to the software after release.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a software developer writes code and implements software
a quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
a project manager oversees the planning , execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environments are soft ware suits that provide comprehensive tools for writing ,debugging, and testing code for example visual studio code and eclipse
Version control systems are software tools used to track changes to to source code and coordinating work among team members


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements which can change during the development cycle which can lead to delays in a project this can be prevented by seeting up a clear mockup design of the full project
and effective communication
Tight deadline that is pressure to deliver software products on time can result in rushed development and compromised quality of products, this can be avoided by regular reassessment of project goals and timelines 
Technical debt which is accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions can be prevented by effective communication using viable methodologies like the Agile methodology


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
